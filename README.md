### DNA Sequence

Based on the National Human Genome Research Institute, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is the chemical compound which consists of the instructions needed to develop and direct the activities of nearly all living organisms. 

A DNA molecule is a double helix structure consisting of two twisted paired strands. DNA consists of four bases which are adenine [A], cytosine [C], guanine [G], or thymine [T]. 

DNA sequence is a laboratory process of determining the sequence of these four bases in a DNA molecule. More info about DNA Sequencing can be found in “Introduction to DNA Sequencing”.
Let’s look at DNA sequence strings manipulation using Python programming language and some NLP techniques in this project. 


### DNA Sequence Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms

There is a huge demand of applying ML to genomics dataset analytics today. Many questions about it are still not very clear at all. Let me mentions some of them:

- What DNA sequence encoder to use based on the selected ML model?
- What ML models to use for generic genomics datasets and how to interpret it?
- How to optimize the ML model hyperparameters?
- How to apply Natural Language processing to DNA sequence as an unstructured text dataset?
- How to handle high dimensional and unlabeled gene expression datasets?
- What method to use to handle genomic datasets with imbalanced classes?
- What metrics to use to validate the ML model with genomics datasets?
- How to expose and consume the ML model using web services API’s call?
- How to design and build a client side and/or desktop application to use these ML models in real research and/or production business environments?



### Selection of the ML model and its hyperparameters optimization is part of the ML project flow from the steps shown below:

- Project description and specifications.
- Data loading.
- Data preprocessing.
- Data exploration and visualization.
- Features engineering and reduction.
- Features and labels encoding.
- Features and labels data splitting.
- Features and labels scaling.
- Model selection and hyperparameters optimization.
- Model cross validation.
- Model prediction.
- Model performance metrics analysis.
- Model production deployment using Web APIs IT application integration.
- Model retraining schedule and redeployment business intelligence and decisions making.

To define this model for specific genomics dataset is an important decision for Bioinformaticians, Biologists and Clinicians. In many use cases this selection is defined, for example, based on the uniformity of the DNA sequence length across the dataset. 

Traditional ML algorithms (Linear and Logistics Regressions, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Boosting Algorithms, Bayesian Network, etc.) can be used with any DNA sequence length. Modern ANN algorithms like CNN and RNN require consistent DNA sequence length in the whole dataset column.
